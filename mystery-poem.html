            <h2>Lyrics of "10,000 Hours" ðŸŽ¶</h2>
            <p>Do you love the rain, does it make you dance<br>
            When you're drunk with your friends at a party?<br>
            What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?<br>
            Do you think of me?<br>
            When you close your eyes<br>
            Tell me, what are you dreamin'?<br>
            Everything, I wanna know it all</p>
        
            <p>I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more<br>
            Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours<br>
            And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try<br>
            If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life<br>
            I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>
        
            <p>Do you miss the road that you grew up on?<br>
            Did you get your middle name from your grandma?<br>
            When you think about your forever now<br>
            Do you think of me?<br>
            When you close your eyes<br>
            Tell me, what are you dreamin'?<br>
            Everything, I wanna know it all</p>
        
            <p>I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more<br>
            Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours<br>
            And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try<br>
            If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life<br>
            I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
            I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>
        
            <p>Ooh, want the good and the bad, everything in between<br>
            Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity<br>
            Oh, yeah</p>
        
            <p>I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more<br>
            Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours<br>
            And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try<br>
            If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life<br>
            I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
            I'm gonna love you, oh yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
            And I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
            I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)</p>
